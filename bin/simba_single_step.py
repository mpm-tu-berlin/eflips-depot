        ##### Step 1: Consumption simulation

        # a consumption value. This is not necessary if you are using an external consumption simulation.
        for vehicle_type in scenario.vehicle_types:

            scenario=scenario, charging_power=150, delete_existing_depot=True
        )

        ##### Step 3: Run the simulation
        # This can be done using eflips.api.run_simulation. Here, we use the three steps of
        # eflips.api.init_simulation, eflips.api.run_simulation, and eflips.api.add_evaluation_to_database
        # in order to show what happens "under the hood".

        ##### Step 3.5: Apply even smart charging
        # This step is optional. It can be used to apply even smart charging to the vehicles, reducing the peak power
        # consumption. This is done by shifting the charging times of the vehicles. The method is called
        # apply_even_smart_charging and is part of the eflips.depot.api module.
        apply_even_smart_charging(scenario)

        #### Step 4: Consumption simulation, a second time
        # The depot simulation merges vehicles (e.g. one vehicle travels only monday, one only wednesday â€“ they
        # can be the same vehicle). Therefore, the driving events for the vehicles are deleted and the vehicles
        # are re-initialized. In order to have consumption values for the vehicles, we need to run the consumption
        # simulation again. This time, we do not need to initialize the vehicles, because they are already initialized.
        simple_consumption_simulation(scenario=scenario, initialize_vehicles=False)

        # The simulation is now complete. The results are stored in the database and can be accessed using the
        session.commit()

        print("Simulation complete.")
