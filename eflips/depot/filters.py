class VehicleFilter:
    """Class to build and apply filters for vehicles. Designed to work with
    simpy FilterStore and subclasses in the depot simulation: Implements
    __call__ to make an instance directly callable and return the all()-result
    of the criteria. Can be recalled. Usable e.g. for simpyExt.FilterStoreExt
    that needs the store item as single positional argument for the filter
    function. Filter criteria are prepared in class methods and can be selected
    and combined before application.

    Parameters:
    filter_names: [list or None] of filter method names (as strings, 'filter_'
        omitted) of this class that should be applied on a vehicle. If left
        None, the VehicleFilter returns True.
    All other parameters that are required by selected filter methods must be
        added as keyword arguments during init (see method descriptions).

    Attributes:
    filters: [list] of one or more VehicleFilter.filter_... methods or other
        valid callables. Filled automatically from *filter_names*. Can be None
        or empty, in which case the VehicleFilter returns True. Entries can be
        added during definition (see filter_names) and afterwards (see
        VehicleFilter.append).

    Usage:
        Instantiate a VehicleFilter object. Pass arguments required for the
        checks, such as filter_names upon instantiation as kwargs or add them
        later.
        Example:
            vf = VehicleFilter(filter_names=['service_need'], env=env)
            trueorfalse = vf(vehicle)
        Static methods may be called without instantiation. Example:
            trueorfalse = VehicleFilter.filter_no_active_processes(vehicle)

    When adding a new filter method:
    - The method name must be preceeded by 'filter_'.
    - 'vehicle' must be the only method parameter. Additional parameters can be
        accessed via the VehicleFilter object attributes. Passing all those
        parameters as keyword arguments during init adds them automatically as
        attribute of the VehicleFilter. Alternatively, attributes might be
        added after init, before calling the filter.
