"""
This package contains the public API for eFLIPS-Depot. It is split to ways:

by function
    The methods for setting up and starting a simulation are in the top-level :mod:`eflips.depot.api` module. The data
    structures for the simulation input are in the :mod:`eflips.depot.api.input` module. The output data structures are
    in the :mod:`eflips.depot.api.output` module.

by interface
    The top-level input and output modules contain only the definitions of the data structures. For interfacing with
    other simulation frameworks, a *separate* module should be created that implements the interface. For example, the
    :mod:`eflips.depot.api.django_simba` module implements the interface for the
    `django-simba <(https://github.com/rl-institut/django-simba)>`_ framework. It is recommended to create subclasses of
    the :class:`eflips.depot.api.input.VehicleType` and :class:`eflips.depot.api.input.VehicleSchedule` classes,
    overriding the :meth:`__init__()` method to read the data from the other simulation framework.
