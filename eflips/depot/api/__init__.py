"""
This package contains the public API for eFLIPS-Depot.

It is to be used in conjunction with the
`eflips.model <https://github.com/mpm-tu-berlin/eflips-model>`_ package, where the Scenario is defined.

Notes on the usage of the API
-----------------------------

The following steps are recommended for using the API:

1. Check if there are already "driving events" in the database. They come from a "consumption simulation" and are
   associated with a vehicle. If there are no driving events, you may use the :func:`simple_consumption_simulation`
   (with ``initialize_vehicles=True``) to create them. This function will also initialize the vehicles in the database
   with the correct vehicle type and assign them to rotations.
2. Check if there is already a depot layout in the database. If there is not, you may use the
   :func:`generate_depot_layout` function to create a simple depot layout and plan.
3. Either use the :func:`simulate_scenario` function to run the whole simulation in one go, or use the following steps:
    a. Use the :func:`init_simulation` function to create a simulation host, which is a "black box" object containing
       all input data for the simulation.
    b. Use the :func:`run_simulation` function to run the simulation and obtain the results.
    c. Use the :func:`add_evaluation_to_database` function to add the results to the database.
4. For the results to be valid, the consumption simulation should now be run again.
    a. If you are using an external consumption model, run it again making sure it does not create new vehicles.
    b. Run the :func:`simple_consumption_simulation` function again, this time with ``initialize_vehicles=False``.

class ConsumptionResult:
    """
    A dataclass that stores the results of a charging simulation for a single trip.

    This class holds both the total change in battery State of Charge (SoC) over the trip
    as well as an optional timeseries of timestamps and incremental SoC changes. When

    distance and consumption.

        The total change in the vehicle's State of Charge over the trip, typically
        negative if the vehicle is consuming energy (e.g., -0.15 means the SoC
        dropped by 15%).

    :param timestamps:
        A list of timestamps (e.g., arrival times at stops) that mark the times
        associated with the SoC changes. The number of timestamps must match the
        number of entries in ``delta_soc``.

    :param delta_soc:
        A list of cumulative SoC changes corresponding to the ``timestamps``.
        For example, if ``delta_soc[i] = -0.02``, it means the SoC decreased by 2%
        between from the start of the trip to ``timestamps[i]``. This list should typically
        be a monotonic decreasing sequence.

    Run a simple consumption simulation and optionally initialize vehicles in the database.

    This function calculates energy consumption by multiplying each vehicle's total traveled
    distance by a constant ``VehicleType.consumption`` (kWh per km), then updates the database
    with the resulting SoC (State of Charge) data. The function can also use precomputed results
    for specific trips via the ``consumption_result`` parameter.

    If ``initialize_vehicles`` is True, vehicles and an initial STANDBY event (with 100% SoC)
    are created for each rotation that does not already have a vehicle. If it is False, existing
    vehicles in the database are assumed, and a check is performed to ensure each rotation has a
    vehicle.

    Opportunity charging can optionally be applied at the end of each trip, if the vehicle and
    station both allow it, and if the rotation is flagged to allow it. This charging event is
    constrained by a configurable terminus deadtime.

    **SoC Constraints**

    - When no precomputed results are provided, SoC is computed by subtracting energy used
      (`consumption * distance / battery_capacity`) from the previous event’s SoC.
    - When precomputed ``ConsumptionResult`` objects are provided in ``consumption_result``,
      they must have a non-positive total change in SoC (``delta_soc_total <= 0``).
      If the function detects a positive ``delta_soc_total``, it raises a ``ValueError``.

    **Timeseries Calculation**

    - If ``calculate_timeseries`` is True, the function builds a more granular SoC timeseries
      at each stop in the trip and stores it in the ``Event.timeseries`` column.
    - If False, the event’s ``timeseries`` is set to ``None``, which may speed up the simulation
      if you do not need intermediate SoC data.

    :param scenario:
        One of:
          - A :class:`eflips.model.Scenario` instance containing the input data for the simulation.
          - An integer specifying the ID of a scenario in the database.
          - Any other object with an integer ``id`` attribute.

        If not passing a :class:`eflips.model.Scenario` directly, the `database_url` parameter
        or the environment variable ``DATABASE_URL`` must point to a valid database.

    :param initialize_vehicles:
        A boolean flag indicating whether new vehicles should be created and assigned
        to rotations in the database. Set this to True the first time you run the simulation
        so that vehicles are initialized. In subsequent runs, set to False if vehicles
        are already present.

    :param database_url:
        A database connection string (e.g., ``postgresql://user:pass@host/db``).
        If you do not provide this and ``scenario`` is not a
        :class:`eflips.model.Scenario` instance, the environment variable
        ``DATABASE_URL`` must be set.

    :param calculate_timeseries:
        If True, each trip’s detailed SoC timeseries is computed and stored in the
        ``timeseries`` column of the corresponding driving and charging events.
        If False, only the start/end SoC is recorded, and ``timeseries`` is set to None.

    :param terminus_deadtime:
        The total time overhead (attach + detach) for charging at the terminus.
        If this deadtime exceeds the available layover time, no charging is performed.

    :param consumption_result:
        A dictionary mapping trip IDs to :class:`ConsumptionResult` instances for
        precomputed SoC changes. If an entry exists for a trip, this function uses
        those precomputed SoC changes instead of calculating them from distance
        and consumption. Each ``ConsumptionResult`` must have:

        - A non-positive ``delta_soc_total`` (<= 0).
        - Optionally, matching lists of timestamps and delta SoC values that are
          decreasing (i.e., the vehicle only loses or maintains SoC).

    :returns:
        ``None``. All simulation results are written directly to the database as
        :class:`eflips.model.Event` entries.

    :raises ValueError:
        - If a rotation in the scenario does not have a vehicle when
          ``initialize_vehicles=False``.
        - If the vehicle type has no ``consumption`` value.
        - If a provided ``ConsumptionResult`` has inconsistent list lengths,
          or if its ``delta_soc_total`` is positive.
        - If SoC timeseries are not decreasing when provided
          via ``consumption_result``.
