"""
This package contains the public API for eFLIPS-Depot.

It is to be used in conjunction with the
`eflips.model <https://github.com/mpm-tu-berlin/eflips-model>`_ package, where the Scenario is defined.

Notes on the usage of the API
-----------------------------

The following steps are recommended for using the API:

1. Check if there are already "driving events" in the database. They come from a "consumption simulation" and are
   associated with a vehicle. If there are no driving events, you may use the :func:`simple_consumption_simulation`
   (with ``initialize_vehicles=True``) to create them. This function will also initialize the vehicles in the database
   with the correct vehicle type and assign them to rotations.
2. Check if there is already a depot layout in the database. If there is not, you may use the
   :func:`generate_depot_layout` function to create a simple depot layout and plan.
3. Either use the :func:`simulate_scenario` function to run the whole simulation in one go, or use the following steps:
    a. Use the :func:`init_simulation` function to create a simulation host, which is a "black box" object containing
       all input data for the simulation.
    b. Use the :func:`run_simulation` function to run the simulation and obtain the results.
    c. Use the :func:`add_evaluation_to_database` function to add the results to the database.
4. For the results to be valid, the consumption simulation should now be run again.
    a. If you are using an external consumption model, run it again making sure it does not create new vehicles.
    b. Run the :func:`simple_consumption_simulation` function again, this time with ``initialize_vehicles=False``.

    A simple consumption simulation and vehicle initialization.

    Energy consumotion is calculated by multiplying the vehicle's total distance by a constant
    ``VehicleType.consumption``.

    If run with ``initialize_vehicles=True``, the method will also initialize the vehicles in the database with the
    correct vehicle type and assign them to rotations. If this is false, it will assume that there are already vehicle
    entries and ``Rotation.vehicle_id`` is already set.

        When running this function for the first time, this should be set to True. When running this function again
        after the vehicles have been initialized, this should be set to False.
