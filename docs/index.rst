Welcome to eFLIPS-Depot's documentation!
========================================

FLIPS has been developed within several research projects at the Department of Methods of Product Development and Mechatronics at the Technische Universit√§t Berlin (see https://www.tu.berlin/mpm/forschung/projekte/eflips).

With eFLIPS, electric fleets and depots can be simulated, planned and designed.
This repository contains only the planning and design tool for depots.

The repository contains an example for the simulation and planning of an electric bus depot, which is based on the dissertation by Dr.-Ing. Enrico Lauth (see https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/items/f47662f7-c9ae-4fbf-9e9c-bcd307b73aa7).
